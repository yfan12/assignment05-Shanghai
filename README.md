Intended Layout: 

The intended layout could be similar to the midterm project that we have done. We could design a homepage using the Z-pattern and a information page using the F-pattern.

Homepage:  
1. Using a coffee picture to be the background image 
2. Link to the log-in page at top-right
3. Link to the survey page at the bottom-left
4. Link to the more-information page at the bottom-right

Information Page: 
1. The page should present more information about coffee
2. At the first glance, the page viewer should see brief description about the                                                       origin of coffee
3. Below the description, I picked information about four types of coffee(Mocha, Cappuccino, Latte, Americano) with picture of each. These four types of coffee should be presented in the content separately.


Intended mood/feeling: 

1. Typeface: The Title should be clear and artful. The content should be more formal, which means the font should be easy for the reader to read.
2. Color Design: Since our topic is about coffee, it would look better if we use the brown color which represents the color of  coffee.


Intended interactivity: 
Survey: The survey could ask for peopleâ€™s job, coffee preference and how often he had a coffee. Therefore, further analyze could be done based on the survey.
Login System: Just simple ask the user to register/log in with a username and password.
Database Functions:  In accordance with the instructions by Professor Kostin.
